# Image Similarity Analysis

This repository contains Python code for comparing images using ORB/SIFT feature detectors and the structural similarity index (SSIM).

The code provided in this repository allows you to compare images using two different methods:

1. **ORB Feature Detector**: ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detector is used to detect keypoints and descriptors in images. The similarity between images is calculated based on the number of similar keypoints found using the ORB detector.

2. **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: The SSIM metric is used to measure the similarity between two images based on their structural information. It provides a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates identical images.

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/ahmetbekir22/image-similarity-analysis.git
